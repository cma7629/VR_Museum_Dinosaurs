# VR_Museum_Rocks
CSC-461/592 Assignment #2: VR Museum

+- Team --
Cal Akins, Stephen Herrera

+- Description --
For our Museum we looked at assets and textures avaliable to us and decided to showcase different types of rocks. Restrictions breed creativity, and restricting ourselves to something simple was a fun way of practicing different thjngs such as applying textures to models and messing with scale without breaking the time bank. The models were also easy to work with and were readily avaliable.
